Maintained by: **Lovable (Architectural Authority)**

## Priority Docs (Read in Order)

| # | File | Why It's Priority |
|---|------|-------------------|
| 1 | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` | Operating agreement: roles, phases, message discipline |
| 2 | `docs/PHASE_DELTAS.md` | Most recent changes since last sync |
| 3 | `docs/development/branches/phase-5.5-cross-document-insights.md` | **ACTIVE** - Cross-document linking & insights |
| 4 | `docs/development/branches/phase-5.3-remisser-remissvar.md` | Phase 5.3 summary (complete) |
| 5 | `docs/CHECKLISTS.md` | Verification requirements before sign-off |
| 6 | `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` | Approved decisions with triple sign-off |
| 7 | `docs/development/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md` | Overall progress and metrics |

## Recent Changes (2026-01-19)

- **COMPLETE:** Phase 5.5.1 Reference Resolution (76 references resolved, limited by corpus)
- **COMPLETE:** Phase 5.5.2 Directive-SOU Linking (8 links: 5 fulfills + 3 cites)
- **Reclassified:** 3 weak semantic matches from `fulfills` → `cites` after review
- **Corpus insight:** Low yield expected — legislative chains span 2-4 years, corpus covers recent docs only
- **NEXT:** Phase 5.5.3 Minimal Insights MVP (participation dashboard, velocity metrics)
